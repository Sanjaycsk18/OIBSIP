          Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin (16 April 1889 - 25 December 1977) was an
          English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the
          era of silent film. He became a worldwide icon through his screen
          persona and is considered one of the film industry's most important
          figures. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the
          Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed
          both adulation and controversy. Charlie Chaplin is widely regarded as
          the greatest comic artist of the screen and one of the most important
          figures in motion-picture history. In 1972 he received a special
          Academy Award for “the incalculable effect he has had on making motion
          pictures the art form of this century”.Chaplin's childhood in London 
          was one of poverty and hardship. Chaplin began performing at an early
          age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and
          comedian.At 19, he was signed to the Fred Karno company, which took
          him to the United States. He was scouted for the film industry and
          began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the
          Tramp persona and attracted a large fan base. He directed his own
          films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the Essanay,
          Mutual, and First National corporations.

          By 1918, he was one of the world's best-known figures. 
          In 1919, Chaplin co-founded distribution
          company United Artists, which gave him complete control over his
          films. His first feature-length film was
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kid_(1921_film)"
            >The Kid (1921)</a
          >, followed by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Woman_of_Paris"
            >Woman of Paris(1923) </a
          >,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gold_Rush"
            >Gold Rush (1925)</a
          >
          , and Circus (1928). He initially refused to move to sound films in
          the 1930s, instead producing
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Lights"
            >City Lights (1931)</a
          >
          and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Times_(film)"
            >Modern Times (1936)</a
          >
          without dialogue. His first sound film was
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dictator"
            >The Great Dictator (1940)</a
          >
          , which satirised Adolf Hitler. He abandoned the
          Tramp in his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947),
          Limelight (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong
          Kong (1967). Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in,
          and composed the music for most of his films. He received an Honorary Academy Award
          for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the
          art form of this century" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation
          for his work. He continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold
          Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked
          on lists of the greatest films.<br class="ref">
